### Nitro XML Converter

# How do I convert a file?

**Make sure you run ``npm i`` before first use.**

The converter currently supports the following files:

- effectmap.xml
- figuremap.xml
- furnidata.xml
- external_texts.txt

To convert one of these files, make sure you have an ``input`` directory, and place the files in it.

Run `npm run start-dev` to convert the files, the output will be in the folder ``output``
